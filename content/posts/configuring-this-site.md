Configuring this site took at least 3 days. No joking. Hugo is such a big project and it involves such a big community and so many choices. Just making decision between themes would take days to explore, and of course, start over.

But finally I settle for this `blowfish` theme.

Here I record some of the boot up steps and --useful-- useless experience.

```
brew install hugo
hugo new site hugo-demo
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
hugo server --debug
```
