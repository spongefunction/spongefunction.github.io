description: hitori.rocks is the domain name I've been using for years even before I switched to be a web developer. Why this string?
---

‘hitori’ means alone in Japanese. So the domain name I've been using - hitori.rocks - means, I rock alone.

It is worth noting that, this domain name has nothing to do with the anime "Bocchi the Rock!" though they have exactly the same meaning. I picked this name in 2021 when I first graduated and spent a lot of time playing with things and Japanese short sentences. That was far before "Bocchi the Rock!". I liked the idea with a joyful resonance when the anime came out.

I remember when I used this domain as email address in my slides at work place, and my leader amazed for such a chic move. Picking one's custom domain is not popular in China at all, for most of activities happen on a few monopoly company's applications. Public websites die away. Personal email die away. People don't even understand what domain is. This is the context when i still buy and use several domains.

By the way I do not play rock music. It's just, kind of, intentionality. :)
