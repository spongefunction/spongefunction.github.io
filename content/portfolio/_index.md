Hi this is my portfolio.
Here are links to my past projects and practices. Some are front end design, and some are front end development.
In all of these projects, I enjoyed the process of designing a product and bring fun experience to my target users. I combined the role of a product manager and a developer, and sometimes, a document writer. I love these jobs.

I take the role of team leaders a lot. Personally I'm not an extrovert, but being the leader role give me better control and more realistic expectation of the project quality, which are worth all the additional subtle work.

Would you consider work with me?
