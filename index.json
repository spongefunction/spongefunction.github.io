Here are links to my past projects and practices. Some are front end design, and some are front end development. In all of these projects, I enjoyed the process of designing a product and bring fun experience to my target users. I combined the role of a product manager and a developer, and sometimes, a document writer. I love these jobs.\nI take the role of team leaders a lot.
