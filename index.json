Wilson is using version 4.4.2 to build a demo project while I prefer to explore with newer version and add some structure and background knowledge to my wander.\nInstallation with homebrew # Official document for installation on Mac:\nhttps://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/\nbrew tap mongodb/brew brew update brew install mongodb-community # To start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community now and restart at login: brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community brew services stop mongodb/brew/mongodb-community # To verify that MongoDB is running, perform one of the following: brew services list # to use MongoDB mongosh # to use the MongoDB Database Tools mongotop The binary command to start MongoDB changed from mongo (v4.4)to mongosh(current version 6.0.6), which may cause some confusion. At first I ran mongo and mongod, and neither gave me correct response.\nAfter checking /usr/local/bin(you can get this path by running brew --prefix) directory, I found all binary commands related with mongo, and legitimately guessed which to run.\nlist of mongo related binary commands:\nmongod mongodump mongoexport mongofiles mongoimport\nmongorestore mongos mongosh mongostat mongotop\nAs the document says: \u0026ldquo;The legacy mongo shell was deprecated in MongoDB 5.0 and removed in MongoDB 6.0. The new MongoDB Shell, mongosh, offers numerous advantages over the legacy shell. \u0026hellip; Some legacy methods are unavailable or have been replaced with updated methods in mongosh. To maintain backwards compatibility, the legacy methods that mongosh supports use the same syntax as the corresponding methods in the mongo shell.\u0026rdquo;\nBasic facts to know about MongoDB # MongoDB is not relational database.\nMongoDB use BSON instead of JSON to store things. BSON stands for Binary JSON. It is a binary encoded serialization of JSON documents, and supports more data formats than JSON - for example, float, and binary objects.\nCollections in MongoDB is like tables in MySQL.\nMongo\u0026rsquo;s shell is a fully functional javascript shell, so it can process js code.\nBasic commands # Within mongosh console, here are some common commands to use:\ndb // to show current database use [someDB] use [anotherDB] show dbs // to show all databases show collections // to show all collections CRUD # Document: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/crud/\nCreate -\u0026gt; insert # // db.collection.insertOne() use sample_mflix db.movies.insertOne( { title: \u0026#34;The Favourite\u0026#34;, genres: [ \u0026#34;Drama\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;History\u0026#34; ], runtime: 121, rated: \u0026#34;R\u0026#34;, year: 2018, directors: [ \u0026#34;Yorgos Lanthimos\u0026#34; ], cast: [ \u0026#34;Olivia Colman\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Emma Stone\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Rachel Weisz\u0026#34; ], type: \u0026#34;movie\u0026#34; } ) // db.collection.insertMany() pass an array of documents to method use sample_mflix db.movies.insertMany([ { title: \u0026#34;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\u0026#34;, genres: [ \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Sci-Fi\u0026#34; ], runtime: 130, rated: \u0026#34;PG-13\u0026#34;, year: 2018, directors: [ \u0026#34;J.

But having the priviledge to invite teammates and design the product made it an enjoyment to me. Iris, Celia, Leon and me worked together in this hackathon so well that we won and used the prize to had a lavish Sichuan hotpot the day after.\nIn June, I saw a post on BrightSpace about a hackathon to be hold on campus. I saw a similar one last semester, but at that time I don\u0026rsquo;t even understand object-oriented-programming, so I let go of the chance. But I\u0026rsquo;ve always been curious about hackathons - what are the ideal level of coding for participation? What will people do during the short period? Can people make practical deliverable results in such events?\nI went to the event with these questions, and to be honest, this hackathon isn\u0026rsquo;t a typical hackathon to answer my questions. But I still solved my confusion and nervousness for tech events. The sponsor of this event is a mature student of AC who has years of experience in crowdsourcing and entrepreneurship. He is collecting website design for his new project, which is going to be used in his roadshow in Montreal. This project has a chance to be deployed! It\u0026rsquo;s thrilling.\nThough we only have a short time to familiarize ourselves with his business mode and demands, we utilized our experience in other internet applications and did good research of like products.\nI did most of the product design. Not sure what it should be called in English context, in short, i did the product manager job. From the talk, we realized the product was going to be a website that allow people to upload pitches and share to their community and audience, especially future investors. What we got from the sponsor\u0026rsquo;s resource is a very vague portrait of users and bizarre mode of business, which is not so clear, unique and appealling for investors. I narrowed down the business mode and offered a clear picture of how this service could be operated and monetized.\nIn my design, this product could have core functions like:\nhomepage browsing event organizing searching posting joining team showcase pitch manaing user profile managing For operation and monetization, it would have 4 essential aspects:\ncommunity events crowdfunding team building storytelling July 8-9 is a short time, but we still made a huge progress in fast pace. We made 8 pages in Figma, while it was the first time for some of us to use it. We learn as we practice and build.\nIris and Leon learned so quickly that they did most creative Figma work, and helped the rest of team to apply our style and principle of design to every detail. Celia made our collaboration remarkably joyful by helping with every rough job and making everyone relaxed with her talent people skill, which I\u0026rsquo;m not fortunate enough to own.\nWe spent 2 days together, from 10 am to 8 or 9 pm. On the second I wore slippers on a whim, because I see a lot of programmers did so when they work. They work overtime (though I worked even longer than them) so their choice might be comfortable enough when one has to sit at table for such a long time. It was proved to be a right choice.\nWhat I got from this event is a complete work, and probably \u0026hellip; much laughter in our meeting room, and many expirience to eat hotpot/go hiking/walking in the park with with Celia, Iris and Leon atfer we grow trust for each other.\nI still have confusion about how a real coding hackathon should be, and if I qualify for engagement, but the confusion would not scare me away from opportunity anymore.\n","date":"18 August 2023","permalink":"/posts/celebrate-first-hackathon-win/","section":"Posts","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s our first time to participate in a hackathon, and first time to create something as a team.

These files will be copied into public folder and referenced.\nassets contains more complicated things, like custom css, fonts and images. Whichever the resource file should be, when configuring in hugo.toml, paths name should start after assets or static. That means, you cannot know which folder to place by just looking at the sample config file. When rendering pages, which folder to check is decided by the hugo or theme program. What\u0026rsquo;s under assets or static folder is what we can decide by modifying the config file.\nModify the default markdown frontmatter # in archetypes/default.md, modify the content so that next time when creating posts with hugo new command, more items could be in the auto-generated markdown file.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s intersting that the default hugo config file is in .toml while posts use yaml as front matter.\n--- title: \u0026#34;{{ replace .Name \u0026#34;-\u0026#34; \u0026#34; \u0026#34; | title }}\u0026#34; date: {{ .Date }} draft: false # slug: your-url-slug categories: - defaultCat01 - defaultCat02 tags: - defaultTag summary: \u0026#34;better to have some summary\u0026#34; --- Get the right size for featured pictures # Accroding to me inspection, the display size of featured image in list is 300 * 180 pixels.
